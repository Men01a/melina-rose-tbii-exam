Tech Basics II Exam Project

This repository contains Melina Rose's Tech Basics II Exam Project code.

It contains a report as a pdf file, the python code (app.py), all images that were used and a README file.

My App "Where to GO?" is supposed to show you all the places nearby that have the capacities to host you and your accompaniment. When you type in how many peopke you're with you get a list of all the places with free space. This works since it has both a profile for the customer as well as a profiler for the shop owner. The shop owner can list the reservations for each day of the week. The customer can choose between places from restaurants to ice cafes, from vegan to all types of food.
So whenever you don't know "Where to GO?",use my app.:))
